## `in` keyword --> `Str`

If you want to see if a string contains some characters or if it contains a **Substring** we can use the `in` keyword.

```python
# Ask the customer if they want fries
fries = input("Do you want fries?") # "yes!"

if "yes" in fries_reply:
    print("Here are your fries.")
else:
    print("OK. You will not have fries.")
```
