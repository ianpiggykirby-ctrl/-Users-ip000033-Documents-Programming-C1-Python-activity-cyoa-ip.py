Markdown is a language we can use to make plain text look good.

# Italics and Bold
We'll begin by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and **bold**. In these lessons, you'll notice some **formatted red text** ; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore ( **_** ). For example, `_this_` word would become italic.

For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.

**Writing in Markdown is not that hard!**



# Headings or Headers 
 Let's take a look at another formatting convention: the header. Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, to draw attention to a section. As their name implies, they act like titles or subtitles above sections.

There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:
# This is header one
## This is header two
### This is header three
#### This is header four
##### This is header five
###### This is header six

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (**# Header One** ), while for a header three, you'd use three (**### Header Three** ).



# Styling Characters

We typically use **bold** and *italicts* to style characters when we type something. You ccan do thoth ***bold and italics*** like this.

We can also use underscores to _bold _ and _ italicize_ words. 

If you want to use stars, use only stars. The same is true for underscores. In other words. 
`* be consistent.*`

# Link 
We'll now learn how to make links to other web sites on the World Wide Web.

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets  `(  [ ]  )`, and then you wrap the link in parentheses `(  ( )  )`.  For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

We can use links in our notes to other pages by using square brackets.  `[]`

## Images
If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. The syntax is nearly the same.

Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).

The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parentheses ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For example, to create an inline image link to https://cdn.ani-com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_mainstage_timetable-5-scaled.jpg , with an alt text that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: ![Benjamin Bannekat](https://cdn.ani-com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_mainstage_timetable-5-scaled.jpg)


# Escape Characters

 *This is some text*
 
 \*This is a fancy text.\* 
 \_\_ \\\\

 The escape character in Markdown is the blackslash (\\).

# Code Blocks
Code blocks allow us to type code and have it styled.
```Python

name = Ian Poon
Age = 16
print(name,age)

```

```Markdown

# This is markdown

** This is bold **

```


# Tables

All tables must have a header row and at least one other row

| Name | Age | Coolness Level |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
